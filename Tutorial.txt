when the project is run, it will load on localhost:3000

You will be greeted by the login page where you only need to enter a name you choose yourself. no security is added in this one.

When you login you have 4 links you can choose from.

All Jokes

Add Joke
Find Joke

All Jokes will show you all the jokes currently in the database and give you a choice to delete them or edit them(note- edit does not work)

Random Joke will move you to a page where a random joke will be fetched from the database.

Add Joke will move you to a page where you will be met with a input field and a button where the text you write there will be the new joke.
The joke will have a defaulth author, link, type.

Find Joke will be a place where you can search the database for the jokes in it, by searching for type.
Newly added jokes will have the type "unique" so if you search for that, only your own jokes will be presented, otherwise search for "short" to get a list of the 6 default jokes there is.
